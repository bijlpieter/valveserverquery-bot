# valveserverquery-bot
## What was this?
It started out as a simple project designed to be able to query valve's source (TF2 in specific) servers using [Valve Server Query Protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries). As a long time mannpower fan, this project then got extended with other features that allow it to display and update current servers in a discord channel for the entire community.

Unfortunately, since Valve moved their official servers to the [SDR](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Datagram_Relay), querying a predefined list of IPs is no longer possible, and thus this project is obsolete.
