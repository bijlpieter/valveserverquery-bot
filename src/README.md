## How to use?
Would you like to use it yourself? Host the (`node.js`) bot locally using `node valveserverquery`, or set it up somewhere else (Mine was hosted on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)).
Use `!query` in your server with the bot to view the search options. Nearly all official TF2 servers by valve will be searched. Note that due to the sheer amount of servers, the server you're searching for may not have been found yet by the bot. It takes around 100 seconds to check every server.
## How does the code work?
There are 3 separate routines:
- Server querying
- User driven search
- Updating mannpower channel
### Server querying
This routine actually queries all of valve's servers. All of the IP ranges (for TF2 specifically) were experimentally determined and may go out of date. Please send PR if you are able to get similar performance using valve's GCs or using valve's [Master Server Query Protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Master_Server_Query_Protocol). Sleeping is used in order to be able to keep up with the incoming responses.
If a server is found with players on it, it will be added to the `servers` object. If the server doesn't have any players on it, it'll be removed. This way the bot keeps a running database of every casual servers. In case of a user search, this object is used in order to quickly find all servers that satisfy the query's conditions.
### User driven search
When the discord bot receives a `!query` or `!stats` (note: stats are still pretty broken), it parses the options, creates a copy of the `servers` object and removes all entries that do not satisfy the users options. It then loops through the remaining entries in the `servers` objects and requeries these servers. The server's response is rechecked, and then sent to the discord channel. This ensures up to date server information.
### Updating mannpower
The final routine continuously loops through the `servers[mp]` object, updating every mannpower server as new ones are added by the server querying routine. The result of the updated server info is updated using a discord webhook which edits a message with all the servers in the object as an embed. If a server ends up being removed, the embed is removed. If a new server pops up, a new embed is added. A webhook is used because you can send up to 10 embeds in a single message, as opposed to a discord bot, which can only add 1.
